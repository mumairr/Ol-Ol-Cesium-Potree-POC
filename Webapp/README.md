# GIS OpenLayers Demo

This repository contains a demonstration project for working with geographic information systems (GIS) using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/). The project showcases how to load, display, and interact with various geospatial data formats (like GeoTIFF) in a web application using React and OpenLayers.

## Features

- **Load and Display GeoTIFF Files**: Render georeferenced raster images in the browser.
- **Map Interaction**: Pan, zoom, and interact with the map.
- **Projection Handling**: Automatically manage different coordinate systems using `proj4`.
- **Responsive Design**: The map interface is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or Yarn (>= 1.x)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mumairr/gis-openlayers-demo.git
cd gis-openlayers-demo
```

### Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and view the project in your browser, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be output to the `build/` directory.
